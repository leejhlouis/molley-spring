This is the repository of Frank P Moley III's Spring Boot course on [LinkedIn learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/certificates/090122a86b3ecb077fcc9717fef50cf636c7dc3341ec960567413fdb5ff81081?u=89670162). The course covers Spring and Spring Boot fundamentals, including but not limited to how to build REST API endpoints using Spring Boot. 

I completed the course on Aug 1, 2024.
